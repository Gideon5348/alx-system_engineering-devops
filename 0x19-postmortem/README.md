Issue Summary:

Duration: February 6th, 2024, 10:34 am to February 8, 2024, 1:00 AM (GMT +3)
Impact: Our web server decided to take a nap, affecting 25% of users who experienced slow loading times and occasional 502 Bad Gateway errors.
Root Cause: Nginx configuration snafu led to a traffic jam, causing the server to struggle under the weight of incoming requests.

Timeline:

·10:00 PM: Monitoring alerts went off like fireworks on New Year's Eve, signaling increased response times and elevated error rates.
·10:10 PM: Engineers sprang into action, suspecting backend issues initially, but soon turned their attention to the Nginx setup.
·10:30 PM: Like detectives following a trail of breadcrumbs, we delved into Nginx configuration files, hunting for clues.
·11:00 PM: The issue escalated faster than rush hour traffic as we realized a misconfigured proxy pass directive was causing chaos.
·12:00 AM: Armed with our trusty text editor and a cup of strong coffee, we swiftly corrected the Nginx configuration to ease the traffic bottleneck.
·12:30 AM: With the configuration fix deployed, the server started humming like a well-oiled machine, and normalcy was restored to our web traffic.
·1:00 AM: Monitoring systems gave the all-clear signal, confirming that our web server was back in action, serving requests like a champ.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of our web server's siesta was traced back to a misconfigured proxy pass directive in the Nginx configuration. This misconfiguration caused incoming requests to get stuck in a traffic jam, resulting in slow response times and intermittent errors. Once we corrected the Nginx configuration to properly route incoming requests, the traffic flow smoothed out, and service resumed to its usual snappy self.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent future traffic jams on our web server, we're implementing the following measures:

1. Nginx Configuration Sanity Checks: Establishing regular audits of Nginx configuration files to catch any misconfigurations before they cause trouble.
2. Automated Testing of Configuration Changes: Implementing automated tests to validate Nginx configuration changes before deployment to catch potential issues early.
3. Documentation and Training: Providing comprehensive documentation and training sessions to ensure all team members are familiar with best practices for Nginx configuration.
4. Monitoring Enhancements: Enhancing monitoring systems to provide more granular visibility into Nginx performance metrics, allowing for early detection of configuration-related issues.


Tasks to Address the Issue:

1. Conduct a thorough review of Nginx configuration files to identify and correct any misconfigurations.
2.Implement automated tests to validate Nginx configuration changes before deployment.
3.Update documentation to include best practices for Nginx configuration and deployment processes.
4.Schedule training sessions for team members to ensure everyone is familiar with Nginx configuration management.

With these measures in place, we're confident that our web server will continue to serve traffic smoothly, without getting stuck in any unexpected traffic jams.
